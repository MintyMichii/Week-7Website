        <th>Those were my steps</th>
        <p>Step 0 : Oil Cleanser</p>
        <p2> Can skip, some people really like cleansing with an oil prior to washing, recommended if you wear makeup </p2> <br>
        
        <div>Step 1: Standard Cleanser</div> <br>
        <p3> Don’t skip this step. Wet face, dispense product, lather in hands, then apply to face ideally in circular movements, being gentle around the eye area. The skin around the eye is the thinnest on our face, so it’s the most fragile. </p3> <br>
        
        <div>Step 2: Serum(s)</div> <br>
        <p4>Highly recommend, there’s lots of different kinds of serums to choose from, which ones you decide to use is dependent on what improvement you’re looking for, for your skin. This shouldn’t be taken lightly! You can have an ineffective skincare routine if you don't know why you’re using a particular serum. You can type in the search bar for serums to get the rundown. <br>
        </p4>
        
        <div>Step 3: Moisturizer</div> <br>
         <p5> Don't skip this step either, especially if you're using serums, you want to lock in the properties of the serum(s).</p5> <br>
        
         <div>Step 4: Sunscreen (Daytime use)</div> <br>
        <p6>The most important. The sun can cause up to 90% of skin aging. Even if you’re indoors, windows only block UVB rays, but it doesn’t block UVA rays, and those are the ones that travel deep into your skin’s dermis shooting free radicals into your skin damaging you’re DNA  </p6>
